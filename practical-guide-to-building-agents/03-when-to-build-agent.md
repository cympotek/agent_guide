# 何時應該建構代理？

## When should you
build an 代理?
建構代理需要重新思考您的系統如何做出決策和處理複雜性。
Unlike conventional 自動化, 代理 are uniquely suited to 工作流程 where traditional
deterministic and rule-based approaches fall short.

考慮支付欺詐分析的例子。 A traditional rules engine works like a checklist,
flagging transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM 代理 functions more like a
seasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious
activity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated. This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what
enables 代理 to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively.

As you evaluate where 代理 can add value, prioritize 工作流程 that have previously resisted
自動化, especially where traditional methods encounter friction:
### 01 Complex 工作流程 involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or
決策-making: context-sensitive 決策, 例如 refund approval
in 客戶 service 工作流程.
### 02 Difficult-to-maintain 系統 that have become unwieldy due to extensive and
rules: intricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone,
例如 performing vendor 安全性 reviews.
### 03 Heavy reliance on Scenarios that involve interpreting natural language,
unstructured data: extracting meaning from documents, or interacting with
使用者 conversationally, 例如 processing a home
insurance claim.
Before committing to building an 代理, validate that your 使用案例 can meet these criteria clearly.
Otherwise, a deterministic 解決方案 may suffice.
