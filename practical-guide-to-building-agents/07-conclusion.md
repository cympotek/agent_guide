Conclusion
代理標誌著工作流程自動化的新時代, where 系統 can reason through ambiguity, take
action across 工具, and handle multi-step tasks with a high degree of autonomy. Unlike simpler
LLM 應用程式, 代理 execute 工作流程 end-to-end, making them well-suited for 使用案例
that involve complex 決策, unstructured data, or brittle rule-based 系統.

To build reliable 代理, start with strong foundations: pair capable 模型 with well-defined 工具
and clear, structured 指令. Use 編排 patterns that match your 複雜性 level,
starting with a single 代理 and evolving to multi-代理 系統 only when needed. 護欄機制 are
critical at every stage, from input filtering and 工具 use to human-in-the-loop intervention, helping
ensure 代理 operate safely and predictably in 生產環境.

The path to successful 部署 isn’t all-or-nothing. Start small, validate with real 使用者, and
grow capabilities over time. With the right foundations and an iterative approach, 代理 can
deliver real 商業 value—automating not just tasks, but entire 工作流程 with intelligence
and adaptability.
